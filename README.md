# init.lua

My current (neo)vim obsession has been rekindled by TJ and his excellent
[Kickstart.nvim configuration template](https://youtu.be/stqUbv-5u2s).

This repository keeps my configuration in sync across multiple OSes.

### Installation

Backup your existing configuration and clone the repository under
`~/.config/nvim`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/attadanta/init.lua ~/.config/nvim
```

Additionally, I installed the recommended dependencies `ripgrep` and `fzf`:

```bash
brew install ripgrep
brew install fzf
```
